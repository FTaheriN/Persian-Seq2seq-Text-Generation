# Persian-Seq2seq-Text-Generation
Training a basic model to generate Persian text with Keras library

The model is trained on [Hafez poets corpus](https://github.com/amnghd/Persian_poems_corpus/blob/master/normalized/hafez_norm.txt). 
The poems are cleaned using the Persian Tokenizer from Spacy library. Used model architecture is fairly simple and can be improved according to needs. 
By saving the model and tokenizer at the end of training, the model can be used to generate new text continuing the input text.
